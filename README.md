# Sketcher
Quark Display 2020

Sketcher was one of the projects displayed in Quark 2020 by the Electronics and Robotics Club, BITS Goa. It is basically a full-scale prototype of a polargraph supporting multiple drawing styles such as stipples, Travelling Salesperson (implementation of the travelling salesperson problem to draw images), D2S,etc.

## Project Members:

[Atharva Sonwane](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as), [Aditya Bidwai](https://github.com/adbidwai), [Vedant Shah](https://github.com/veds12), Advait Kulkarni, Anirudha Srinivas, Kinshuk Singh

## Software:

1.) Polargraph Controller : To control the movement of the motors

    https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller

2.) Drawbot_image_to_gcode : To convert the input images into D2S(Death to Sharpie format):

    git clone https://github.com/Scott-Cooper/Drawbot_image_to_gcode_v2

3.) Processing : To run Drawbot codes

    https://processing.org/download/
  
4.) StippleGen2 : To convert images into Stipple Format and develop TSP paths from it.

    https://github.com/evil-mad/stipplegen

## Hardware:

1.) Nema 17 motors

2.) A4988 motor drivers

3.) Arduino Uno

4.) 5 mm GT2 timing belts

5.) Servo Motor : MG90S

7.) SMPS Power Supply : 12V, 2A, 25W

The drawing board is supported by an easel. The gondola to hold the pen and the servo motor and the weight buckets are 3d printed.
